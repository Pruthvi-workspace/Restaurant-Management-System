## 🧪 Sample Workflow

> Login → View/Add Menu Items → Take Order → Generate Bill → Manage Staff

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Manager manager = new Manager();
        manager.displayMenu();
    }
}
```

---

## 📚 Code Highlights

### 📁 `Manager.java`
Handles user inputs and navigates between modules.

```java
public void displayMenu() {
    // Display menu options
    // Switch between Item, Order, Billing, and Employee management
}
```

### 👨‍🍳 `Employee.java`

```java
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private String role;
    // Getters, Setters, Constructor
}
```

### 🧾 `DataGeneration.java`

```java
public void loadData() {
    // Load data from menu.txt or Employee.txt
}
```

### 🔐 `User.java`

```java
public boolean authenticate(String inputUsername, String inputPassword) {
    return username.equals(inputUsername) && password.equals(inputPassword);
}
```
